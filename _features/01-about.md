Hello! My name is **Hyogi Sim**. I am a HPC Systems Engineer 
in the [Technology Integration Group](https://techint.nccs.gov/)
under [National Center for Computational Sciences](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/tag/nccs/)
(NCCS) at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/).
I design and develop softwares for file and storage systems that serve
large-scale HPC systems like
[Titan](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/olcf-resources/compute-systems/titan/)
and [Summit](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/olcf-resources/compute-systems/summit/).

I am also a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu)
at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu).
I work with [Dr. Ali R. Butt](http://people.cs.vt.edu/butta/), who leads
the [Distributed Systems and Storage Laboratory](https://research.cs.vt.edu/dssl)
(DSSL).
My research interest primarily lies in large-scale storage systems
and scientific data management. I am also
interested in general topics in file systems and database management systems.
